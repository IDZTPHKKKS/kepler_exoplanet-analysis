# Exoplanet Disposition Prediction using Kepler Data

This project aims to predict the disposition of exoplanets observed by NASAâ€™s Kepler mission using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains several key features related to the exoplanets and their host stars. 

## Dataset Description

The features in the dataset include:

- **Orbital Period (koi_period)**: The number of days it takes for an exoplanet to complete one orbit around its star.
- **Exoplanet Radius (koi_prad)**: The radius of the exoplanet in Earth radii.
- **Star Radius (koi_srad)**: The radius of the star around which the exoplanet orbits, in solar radii.
- **Star Temperature (koi_steff)**: The effective temperature of the host star, in Kelvin.
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (koi_model_snr)**: A measure of the data quality; higher values represent clearer data.
- **Target Variable (koi_disposition)**: This variable indicates the disposition of the exoplanet. It has three possible values:
  - 0: **False Positive** - The exoplanet is a false detection.
  - 1: **Candidate** - The exoplanet is a potential candidate for further investigation.
  - 2: **Confirmed** - The exoplanet is a confirmed detection.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset undergoes several preprocessing steps before being fed into the machine learning model:

1. **Missing Value Handling**: 
   - Columns with more than 50% missing data are dropped.
   - Missing values in numerical columns are imputed using the median value of the column.
   
2. **Feature Scaling**: 
   - All features are normalized using `StandardScaler` to ensure they are on a similar scale, improving model performance.
   
3. **Handling Class Imbalance**: 
   - The dataset is imbalanced, so **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** is used to generate synthetic samples for the under-represented classes.

## Model and Evaluation

The machine learning model used in this project is the **RandomForestClassifier**, which is a powerful ensemble learning method. To optimize the model, **GridSearchCV** is used to perform hyperparameter tuning, including the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of trees, and the minimum number of samples required to split a node.

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: The percentage of true positives among all predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The percentage of true positives among all actual positives.
- **F1-score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix showing the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

- ## Data Visualization

To better understand the dataset and its features, the following visualizations were created:
